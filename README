Introduction
------------

dex is a small and easy to use text editor. Colors and bindings can be
fully customized for your likings.

It has some features useful to programmers, like ctags support and it
can parse compiler errors. But it does not aim to become an IDE.


Installation
------------

The only dependency is libc, no curses or any other libraries are
required.

To compile this program you need GNU make and a modern C-compiler
(tested with gcc and clang).

You need to specify all options for both "make" and "make install".
Alternatively you can put your build options into Config.mk file.

	make prefix=$HOME
	make prefix=$HOME install

Default prefix is /usr/local and DESTDIR works as usual. See top of the
Makefile for more information.
